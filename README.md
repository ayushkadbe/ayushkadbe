### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ayush Kadbe

I'm a Business Analyst and founder-operator in the making, focused on:

- ðŸ§  **Innovation Consulting** â€” R&D across Web3, Data Science, and AI automation  
- ðŸ“ˆ **Growth Hacking** â€” Building scalable customer acquisition systems (because revenue solves most problems)  
- ðŸŒ± **Non-Profit Innovation** â€” Designing scalable systems for education, social good, and long-term impact

Iâ€™m passionate about designing systems that create lasting change â€” at the intersection of technology, business, and purpose.

I thrive in collaborative, cross-domain environments where execution meets experimentation, and innovation meets scale.
