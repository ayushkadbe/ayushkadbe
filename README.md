### 👋 Hi, I’m Ayush Kadbe

I'm a Business Analyst and founder-operator in the making, focused on:

- 🧠 **Innovation Consulting** — R&D across Web3, Data Science, and AI automation  
- 📈 **Growth Hacking** — Building scalable customer acquisition systems (because revenue solves most problems)  
- 🏗️ **Venture Building** — Taking ideas from 0 to 1 using PMF playbooks, MVPs, and hierarchy structuring  
- 💼 **Venture Capital & Scouting** — Mapping trends, sourcing startups, and partnering with innovative founders  
- 🌱 **Non-Profit Innovation** — Designing scalable systems for education, social good, and long-term impact

I’m passionate about designing systems that create lasting change — at the intersection of technology, business, and purpose.

I thrive in collaborative, cross-domain environments where execution meets experimentation, and innovation meets scale.
